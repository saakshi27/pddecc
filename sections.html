The total area measuring 240480 acres of Defence Land situated in various parts of the country falls under the jurisdiction of Central Command.  An area measuring 67830 acres falls inside the Cantonment and 172650 acres are situated outside Cantonment.  Necessary entries in the Govt record i.e. GLR/MLR have been updated.  Necessary guidelines have been given to field Offices for survey and demarcation of Defence land.  However, the responsibility of day to day management of Defence land is with the DEO / user services.</br>
</br>On Land matters PDDE provides advisory inputs to HQRs Central Command / LMA as and when sought for.  Properties situated inside the Cantt are held on lease/old grant and are managed by CEO/DEOs.  While dealing with such cases problem /querries raised by the field offices are solved and guidelines are given to proceed further strictly in accordance with the rules and regulations framed by the Govt from time to time. Any instructions / policy matter that are received from the higher formations are immediately circulated to field offices for implementation thereof. 
</br></br>A major problem now-a-days is of unauthorized construction and encroachment on defence land particularly on the vacant land and streets of civil area of the Cantonment.  To stop such unauthorized/illegal activities, field offices i.e. DEO/CEO are repeatedly directed by PDDE to take effective steps for removal of unauthorized construction / encroachments from the defence land. </p>

                        <p class="para">
                            Defence Estates Department is a nodal agency for acquisition of land for, Army, Air Force, Navy and DRDO.  Any project where acquisition of land is involved relating to above organizations is principally approved by the Govt. and then the concerned organization convenes a Board of officers including a member of the respective DEO Circle.  
                        </br></br>After completion of Board proceedings the proposal for the requisite land acquisition is initiated by the DEO (annexed with relevant documents showing the estimated cost of land and rehabilitation charges where involved.)  alongwith his comments  and recommendations for obtaining govt. sanction. 
                        </br></br>At the PDDE level the proposal is examined at length and transmitted to DG DE.  The land acquisition is processed under LA Act, 1894.  On receipt of Govt. sanction DEO places the demand before the Collector/LAO for acquisition of land for the proposed project.  Following the due process laid down in the LA Act ie. Publication of notification under section 4(1) and 6 draft award is sent by the concerned civil authorities for declaration of the final award.  If the amount is required more than the sanctioned amount excess funds are placed with the DEO for remitting the same in favour of the Collector/LAO for declaration of final award. 
                        </br></br>After declaration of final award and after the required compensation is placed with the concerned LAO the possession of the acquired land is taken and handed over to the user unit simultaneously.  DEO soon after taking over of possession makes necessary entries in the MLR and Raksha Bhoomi Database. 
                        </br></br>If at all any court case arises during the acquisition process or after the completion of acquisition proceedings it is defended by the LAO/DEO.  
                        </br></br>In addition to the acquisition of land there are several properties (land and building) held on hiring for which rentals are paid by the DEO Offices by making budgetary provisions in the respective budgets.  </p>
